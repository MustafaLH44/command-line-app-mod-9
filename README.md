## User Story
   Given a user runs my command line application
   Then a some prompts pop one after a another asking the user about their README.md file, like, 'What is the title of your application?', 'What is the description of your app?',
   'What is your apps Installations Instructions?',
   'What is you app Usage?','Which is the License information?', 
   'What is the contributing?', 'What is the Tests for your app?'
   After the user gets through answering these questions then we will render that infromation into a new README.md file if there is one then we will modify the information that is already there. We will also render the correct license baghe image based of the options we have avaliable for th user to pick from
   It is complete after all these steps have been followed and right license badge is in the README.md file
